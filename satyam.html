		<p>Senior Engineering Manager - Security Workflows
at GitHub (View all jobs)
Remote - US / Canada

<center>With so much of the software world built on open source, it’s shocking that only 4% of open source projects have ever published a security vulnerability. The problem is not that maintainers aren’t finding and fixing vulnerabilities; it’s that the current methods for publicizing them is painful and bureaucratic and there’s a lingering negative stigma around them. The Security Workflows team aims to change that!</center>

The Security Workflows team at GitHub is responsible for building the parts of GitHub that help open source maintainers and consumers interact with the Open Source ecosystem more securely. The team is responsible</br> for, among other things, GitHub Security Advisories, GitHub Security Alerts, and administering GitHub's CVE Numbering Authority scope to issue CVEs for eligible vulnerabilities in the Open Source world.

GitHub is looking for an experienced engineering manager to lead our Security Workflows team!

Here are some of the signs of a successful Engineering Manager at GitHub:

    The team always understands the “why” and knows what success looks like for any given product or feature.
<p>

    Team members are <br>empowered and demonstrate a strong sense of ownership.
    The team ships products, features and bug fixes regularly.
    Individuals on the team are learning, growing and advancing in their respective careers.
    The team is responsive to recruiting and interview needs.
