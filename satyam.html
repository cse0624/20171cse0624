<p>
With so much of the software world built on open source,
it’s shocking that only 4% of open source projects have ever published a security vulnerability.
The problem is not that maintainers aren’t finding and fixing vulnerabilities; 
it’s that the current methods for publicizing them is painful and bureaucratic and there’s a lingering negative stigma around them. The Security Workflows team aims to change that!</p>

The Security Workflows team at GitHub is responsible for building the parts of GitHub that help open source maintainers and consumers interact with the Open Source ecosystem more securely. The team is responsiblefor, among other things, GitHub Security Advisories, GitHub Security Alerts, and administering GitHub's CVE Numbering Authority scope to issue CVEs for eligible vulnerabilities in the Open Source world.</tt><</p>


GitHub is looking for an experienced engineering manager to lead our Security Workflows team!
Here are some of the signs of a successful Engineering Manager at GitHub:

<p>
